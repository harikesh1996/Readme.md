 # What work did you get
### Task 
 1. Creating a spreadsheet of self evaluation & other evaluation  
 2. Put on the formula of average in the average column. 
 3. If average column Value is equal to or less than then row column should be appear red.

# How to write formulae
              =SUM(COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Excellent")*5,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Very Good")*4,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Good")*3,
              COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Satisfatory")*3,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Fair")*2,
              COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Poor")*0,)/COUNTA(C4:J4)

  # How does the formulae work? 
  
           1.Get the average of a rating of numbers. 
           2.Syntax = SUM(COUNTIF(range,"string1")*number1,COUNTIF(range,"string2")*number2)/COUNTA(range)
           3. Average, which is the arithmetic mean, and is calculated & countif means range selected by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count   of range numbers.
