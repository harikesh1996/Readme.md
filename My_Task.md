 # What work did you get
### Task 
 1. Creating a spreadsheet of self evaluation & other evaluation  
 2. Put on the formula of average in the average column. 
 3. If average column Value is equal to or less than then row column should be appear red.

# How to write formulae
              =SUM(COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Excellent")*5,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Very Good")*4,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Good")*3,
              COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Satisfatory")*3,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Fair")*2,
              COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Poor")*0,)/COUNTA(C4:J4)

# How does the formulae work?

### Excel AVERAGE Function

**Summary**
The Excel AVERAGE function calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of supplied numbers. AVERAGE can handle up to 255 individual arguments, which can include numbers, cell references, ranges, arrays, and constants.
      
      1.Get the average of a group of numbers
      2.Syntax = SUM(COUNTIF(range,"string1")*number1,COUNTIF(range,"string2")*number2)/COUNTA(range)
      3.The AVERAGE function calculates the average of string. To calculate the average, Excel sums all string and divides by the count of numeric values. This behavior can be replicated with the SUM and COUNT functions.
